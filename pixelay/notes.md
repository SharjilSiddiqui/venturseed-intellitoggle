# Pixelay Comparison Notes

Pixelay was used to visually compare the implemented homepage against the provided Figma design on both desktop and mobile breakpoints.

## Desktop Overlay Notes
- Overall layout structure matches the Figma design very closely across all major sections.
- Minor spacing differences (≈4–8px) were observed in some vertical paddings, particularly between stacked sections.
- Gradient backgrounds match direction and color tone, though subtle texture overlays (grid/pixel effect) appear slightly softer than the reference.
- Button sizing and alignment are consistent with the design, with negligible differences in border thickness on outlined buttons.

## Mobile Overlay Notes
- Mobile layout reflows correctly with all sections stacking in the intended order.
- Typography scales well on smaller screens; however, some headings appear slightly larger than the Figma reference.
- Icon and logo scaling differs marginally, but visual hierarchy remains intact.
- CTA sections remain fully visible without overflow or clipping issues.

## Summary
The implementation achieves a high level of visual fidelity. Observed differences are minor and primarily related to spacing precision, font rendering, and subtle background texture intensity.
